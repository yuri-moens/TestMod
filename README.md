This mod is made to illustrate a bug (IMO). It should draw a white rectangle on top of all the stones in the mines.
This works in all cases *except* when the zoom level is set to 100% and the UI scale is set to anything but 100%. Every change in the UI scale option makes the drawings go further
and further out of sync.
